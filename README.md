RH Copter

The goal of this project is to create a fully autonomous quadcopter using the Beaglebone black.  I'm hoping that putting the code available publicly will lead to someone finding some use out of my code samples.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me: pstudans at gmail.com.

I'm just now getting things set up, but I hope to improve as I go...

Currently I have some preliminary code for SainSmart NEO-6M GPS Module (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009YDK6NA/) using I2C.

I have various other components for which I will be listing and adding code.
